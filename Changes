Version 0.09635001 | 2012-07-22 08:40:13Z (Sun, 22 Jul 2012) | 5dae2c1

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * Define FL_LIBRARY during build
     * Work around Win32 bug

    Notes:
     * Builds against r9635 of the 1.3.x branch of fltk

Version 0.07704001 | 2010-09-18 01:55:22Z (Sat, 18 Sep 2010) | 70e72ea

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * #define symbols for dirent location were malformed

Version 0.07694001 | 2010-09-04 03:56:05Z (Sat, 04 Sep 2010) | 45bb2d7

    Selected Upstream Changes:
     * [r7704] Fixed Windows class name (xclass) setup and caching mechanism.
       This was not yet completely converted to UTF-8. Cleaned up related
       code, removed old comments.
       Tested and confirmed that the xclass() setup works and that different
       icons can be set for different window classes (as it was in FLTK
       1.1.10).
     * [r7697] Full support of UTF-8 text for PostScript printing/output in 2
         ways:
          - Latin characters (unicode <= 17F) and a few other symbols, among
            which the ?\226?\130?\172 (Euro), are output using vectorial fonts
          - All other characters are output as a bitmap copy of their
            offscreen rendition.
     * [r7696] Simpler PostScript output of Fl_Bitmap objects
     * [r7695] PostScript output of Fl_Pixmap objects: accept now arbitrarily
       large pixmaps

Version 0.07694001 | 2010-09-04 03:56:05Z (Sat, 04 Sep 2010) | 45bb2d7

    Notes:
     * Builds against r7694 of the 1.3.x branch of fltk

Version 0.07063001 | 2010-02-15 22:06:30Z (Mon, 15 Feb 2010) | b0766e6

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * Untested CygWin configuration and build fixes

    Notes:
     * For now, we only support Win32-ish CygWin builds. In the future, we may
       include X11-like builds. But don't count on it.

Version 0.07063 | 2010-02-13 16:54:31Z (Sat, 13 Feb 2010) | 0bfc53b

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * Rather than X11, OSX/Darwin uses Carbon for graphics so we no longer
       search for X11-related libs

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * The XCursor lib is now noted as being optional in POD and README

    Notes:
     * This dist also includes other OS X 'fixes' which are completly untested
       and will probably fail
     * Upgraded fltk lib to svn r7063. See the following changelogs for more:
       - http://fltk.org/articles.php?L967 (r7020 snapshot)
       - http://fltk.org/articles.php?L968 (r7034 snapshot)
       - http://fltk.org/articles.php?L970 (r7037 snapshot)
       - http://fltk.org/articles.php?L973 (r7063 snapshot)

Version 0.07008017 | 2010-02-10 07:18:40Z (Wed, 10 Feb 2010) | 364f273

     Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * X11-related libs are now linked in the correct, working order (I hope)

Version 0.07008016 | 2010-02-09 21:35:54Z (Tue, 09 Feb 2010) | 37735bc

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Alien::FLTK has been split into two projects. See Notes below.
     * cflags() and cxxflags() no longer include list of include directories
     * Renamed include_path() => include_dirs() now that it returns all
          required include directories
     * Internal method config('blah') now returns blah's data in the config
          hash
     * Compile using Quartz drawing instead of X11 on Apple OS X
     * Four months of stuff I forgot to keep the changelog up to date for. You
           could check out the commit logs if you're bored.

    Notes:
     * When stable, this will be an API-breakin' release
     * Alien::FLTK has been split into two projects. The first, Alien::FLTK
           will now build the stable 1.3.x branch of FLTK while Alien::FLTK2
           will build the 2.0.x branch.

Version 0.06921 | 2009-10-11 05:50:42Z (Sun, 11 Oct 2009) | 335da88

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Upgrading to r6921
     * include_path() and library_path() methods are (hopefully) less flimsey
     * Slightly better platform handling

Version 0.06916 | 2009-10-11 05:50:42Z (Sun, 11 Oct 2009) | 335da88

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * lib/header checks (should) now work on Unix
     * configure action /should/ work on Solaris

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Upgrading to r6916
     * We configure fltk before creating Build script in case we run into
          trouble (typically missing libs on *nix) and need to exit(0) so test
          results in NA

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * Full OO syntax is now used in docs, tests, and examples
     * Trimmed down t/0000_use/0002_exe.t so tests don't fail under tunneled X11

    Notes:
     * I'll get this right eventually... ((sigh))

Version 0.06879 | 2009-10-04 04:46:04Z (Sun, 04 Oct 2009) | b9cf221

    Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * None yet

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * More spitballing with *nix

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * capabilities() and config() methods are now documented

    Notes:
     * Upgrading to fltk2 r6858 which comes with a modified license which
         remains "in the spirit of the original FLTK 2 license, but at the
         same time [complies with] Debian license requirements."

Version 0.06844 | 2009-09-03 05:03:50Z (Thu, 03 Sep 2009) | 7ea0002

     Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * It actually works (...on Windows, at least)

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Alternatives are presented when we fail to download fltk's source
     * Building fltk2 using ExtUtils::CBuilder and manual configuration

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * New GL example: example/0003_gl.pl
     * Adding list of prerequisites for non-Win32 systems

    Notes:
     * With the required X11-related libs installed, Alien::FLTK builds and
         tests just fine on my Xubuntu box but I've received nothing but
         FAIL-mail from CPAN Testers on non-Win32 systems. ...I'll take
         suggestions from any *nix knowledgeable person who'd like to help.
