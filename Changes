Version 0.06844 | 2009-09-03 04:39:20Z (Thu, 03 Sep 2009) | d495603

     Resolved Issues/Bug Fixes:
     * It actually works (...on Windows, at least)

    Internal/Behavioral Changes:
     * Alternatives are presented when we fail to download fltk's source
     * Building fltk2 using ExtUtils::CBuilder and manual configuration

    Documentation/Sample Code/Test Suite:
     * New GL example: example/0003_gl.pl
     * Adding list of prerequisites for non-Win32 systems

    Notes:
     * With the required X11-related libs installed, Alien::FLTK builds and
         tests just fine on my Xubuntu box but I've received nothing but
         FAIL-mail from CPAN Testers on non-Win32 systems. ...I'll take
         suggestions from any *nix knowledgeable person who'd like to help.
